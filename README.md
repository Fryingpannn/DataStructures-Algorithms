# Data Structures & Algorithms
Programs to practice data structures &amp; algorithms. Includes classrom & non-classroom work.

- **A1:** Recursive vs Iterative, backtracking algorithm, complexity analysis. Finding all possible permutations of a given binary string with masked patterns.
- **A2:** Depth-First Search & Breadth-First Search, Recursion vs Iterative, Stack & Queues, complexity analysis. Board game in which one has to find a given value. 
- **A3:** Priority Queue, Heap implementation with ArrayList, Upheap/Downheap, Bottom-up Heap Construction, Unsorted/sorted Linked List implementation, complexity analysis. Simulation of CPU scheduling for processes/jobs similar to an operating system with a priority queue.
- **A3:** AVL Tree, Balancing a Binary Tree, Tree Traversals, Merge Sorting, Binary Search. Program which adapts the underlying data structure used depending on the size of data.
